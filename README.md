# NLP_Finance_langchain
This project is a Financial News Summarizer & RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Analyzer, built using Python and Streamlit. It allows users to input a Yahoo Finance article URL, scrape the article content, and generate a concise summary using LLaMA 3.2 via Ollama. The app performs sentiment analysis with FinBERT, detects political bias based on keyword similarity, and enriches the summary by retrieving related financial news using FAISS vector search combined with Ollama embeddings. The tool helps visualize key insights from financial news articles and provides contextual background to assist readers in understanding market implications. It leverages technologies such as Streamlit for the UI, BeautifulSoup for scraping, Hugging Face Transformers for sentiment analysis, LangChain + FAISS for RAG retrieval, and Ollama for running LLaMA locally. The app features include summarization, sentiment scores, bias detection, display of related documents, and the ability to download the summary as a text file. It is designed for educational and research purposes and should not be considered financial advice. To run the app, users need to have Ollama running locally with the required models (llama3.2, nomic-embed-text
